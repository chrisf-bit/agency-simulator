# Agency Simulator - Tutorial Video Script
**Duration:** ~2 minutes

---

## INTRO (10 seconds)

**[Show landing screen with Amber Group logo]**

"Welcome to Agency Simulator! You're about to take the helm of a creative agency. Your mission? Grow the business, keep clients happy, and stay profitable. Let's show you how."

---

## THE DASHBOARD (20 seconds)

**[Show main game screen]**

"This is your command centre. Along the top, you'll see your vital stats — cash, reputation, staff count, utilization, burnout, and clients. Keep an eye on these. They tell the story of your agency's health."

**[Highlight tabs]**

"Use these tabs to check your quarterly results, agency metrics, and client pipeline. Information is power."

---

## WINNING NEW WORK (30 seconds)

**[Show Client Opportunities panel]**

"Each quarter, new opportunities appear. You'll see the client name, the work type, the budget, hours required, and crucially — your win chance."

**[Click to select an opportunity]**

"Select the opportunities you want to pitch for. Then decide: do you offer a discount to sweeten the deal? And what quality level will you deliver — Budget, Standard, or Premium?"

**[Show existing client project with purple badge]**

"Keep your clients happy and they'll come back with more work. These 'Existing Client' projects have much higher win rates — relationships matter."

---

## RUNNING YOUR AGENCY (30 seconds)

**[Show Staffing section]**

"Need more capacity? Hire staff. Overstretched? Sometimes you need to let people go. Every decision has a cost."

**[Show Growth Focus slider]**

"This slider is key. Push towards 'New Biz' to chase new clients, or focus on 'Organic' to nurture existing relationships. Balance is everything."

**[Show Investments section]**

"Invest in your agency — client satisfaction, technology, training, marketing, wellbeing. Where you put your money shapes what kind of agency you become."

---

## THE GOAL (20 seconds)

**[Show capacity planning bar]**

"Watch your utilization. Too low and you're wasting capacity. Too high and your team burns out. Aim for that sweet spot."

**[Show cash and profit]**

"Stay profitable. Stay solvent. Run out of cash and it's game over."

**[Quick montage of different screens]**

"Grow your reputation. Build your client base. Make smart bets. And remember — every quarter is a new chance to adapt."

---

## OUTRO (10 seconds)

**[Show Submit button]**

"When you've made your decisions, hit Submit. Once all teams are in, the quarter advances automatically and you'll see how your choices played out."

**[Return to logo]**

"Good luck. Your agency awaits."

### PRODUCTION NOTES

**Music:** Upbeat corporate/tech background track, builds slightly toward the end

**Visuals:** Screen recordings with subtle zoom/pan, highlight boxes on key UI elements

**Voiceover:** Clear, professional, medium pace — not rushed but not slow
