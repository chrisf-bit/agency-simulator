## 📊 THE WINNING FORMULA

### Golden Rules
1. **Utilization sweet spot: 70-85%** — Too low = wasted capacity, too high = burnout spiral
2. **Happy clients = easy wins** — Existing client projects have 70-95% win rates vs 35-65% for new
3. **Reputation compounds** — Higher rep = better win chances = more wins = higher rep
4. **Cash is survival** — Bankrupt = game over, even if you were winning

## ✅ WHAT WORKS

### Client Strategy
| Action | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Invest in Client Satisfaction (£30-50k/Q) | Keeps clients happy, generates high-win-rate project opportunities |
| Prioritize existing client projects | 70-95% win rate vs 35-65% for new clients |
| Renew contracts before they expire | Retention is cheaper than acquisition |
| Watch satisfaction levels | Below 40% = churn risk, below 50% = no project opportunities |

### Pitching Strategy
| Action | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| 10-15% discount on important pitches | +5-7.5% win chance, worth it for strategic clients |
| Premium quality on big clients | +10% win chance, builds reputation |
| Target high win% opportunities first | 65% base > 35% base, obviously |
| Don't pitch everything | Spreading thin hurts all win chances |

### Growth Focus Slider
| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 30-50% (Balanced) | ✅ OPTIMAL — nurtures existing + wins new |
| 0-30% (Organic) | Good for consolidation, may miss growth |
| 70-100% (New Biz) | ⚠️ PENALTY — up to 9% off all win chances |

### Investments That Pay Off
| Investment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Tech (£20-40k/Q) | +win chance on pitches, especially digital |
| Training (£20-40k/Q) | +win chance, reduces errors |
| Wellbeing (£10-30k/Q) | Reduces burnout, protects satisfaction |
| Client Satisfaction | Directly boosts client happiness |
| Marketing | Helps when reputation is low |

### Staffing
| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Utilization >90% | Hire 1-2 staff (£15k each) |
| Utilization <60% | Consider letting go (£5k severance) |
| Burnout >50% | Don't hire more work, invest in wellbeing |
| Won big client | Hire BEFORE next quarter hits |

## ❌ WHAT DOESN'T WORK

### Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Max growth focus (100%) | -9% win chance on ALL pitches |
| Ignoring satisfaction spend | Clients churn, miss project opportunities |
| Budget quality always | Hurts satisfaction (-5%), damages reputation |
| Over-hiring early | Burns cash, drops utilization, looks bad |
| Pitching for everything | Spreads resources thin, wins nothing |
| Ignoring burnout | Spirals into satisfaction drops → churn |
| Zero discount always | Leaves winnable pitches on the table |
| 50% discount always | Wins clients but destroys margins |

### Death Spirals to Avoid
1. **The Burnout Spiral**
   - Over-capacity → High burnout → Low satisfaction → Churn → Panic hiring → More burnout

2. **The Cash Crunch**
   - Aggressive hiring → Low utilization → High costs → Cash drain → Bankruptcy

3. **The Reputation Collapse**
   - Budget quality → Unhappy clients → Low reputation → Fewer wins → Desperation discounts → No profit

4. **The Growth Trap**
   - Max new biz focus → Win penalty → Lose pitches → Fall behind → Push harder → Lose more

## 🎭 FACILITATOR TIPS

### Good Debrief Questions
- "You had 90% utilization but high burnout — what would you do differently?"
- "Team X won with lower revenue but higher margins — why?"
- "What happened when you ignored client satisfaction?"
- "Did anyone discover the existing client project strategy?"

### Common Player Realizations
- "We should have invested in satisfaction earlier"
- "Growth focus slider actually hurt us"
- "Existing client projects were easy wins we ignored"
- "We hired too fast and ran out of cash"
- "Budget quality killed our reputation"

### Let Them Fail
- Don't hint at the growth focus penalty
- Let at least one team go bankrupt (great learning moment)
- Let teams discover existing client projects organically
- The "aha moments" are the learning
